# Bible Explored Web Application in React
## How to Setup


### 1. Make sure appropriate Node and NPM Versions are used to fully replicate all dependencies.
```
node version = 18.16.0
npm version = 9.5.1
```
**Note:** It's better to use NVM to install node so you can quickly change node versions

### 2. Clone the entire project
```
git clone https://github.com/sergelorenz/bible-explored
```

### 3. Install packages
```
cd bible-explored-react
npm ci
```
`npm ci` installs the exact versions of packages from package-lock.json

### 4. Run the application
```
npm start
```
